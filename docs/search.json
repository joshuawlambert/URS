    "text": "The Costco Food Sample Analogy\nThink of statistical inference like sampling food at Costco. When you try a free sample, you’re tasting a small portion of a much larger product. Your impression of the sample influences your decision on whether to purchase the entire product. Similarly, in research, a sample represents a subset of the population, and conclusions drawn from this sample help infer characteristics or outcomes for the whole population.\nThis metaphor helps make the abstract concept of statistical inference more tangible and relatable for undergraduate nursing students."

By comparing satisfaction scores between hospitals, administrators can identify strengths and areas needing improvement, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes."
